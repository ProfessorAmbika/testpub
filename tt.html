* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Interpreter_**: An interpreter is a computer program that is used to directly execute program instructions written using one of the many high-level programming languages. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Data types_** are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Variables_** are reserved memory locations to store values. Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Tuple_** is a collection of objects which ordered and immutable. Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Comments_** in Python are the lines in the code that are ignored by the compiler during the execution of the program. Comments enhance the readability of the code and help the programmers to understand the code very carefully. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Operators_** in general are used to perform operations on values and variables. These are standard symbols used for the purpose of logical and arithmetic operations. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Operator precedence_** determines how operators are parsed concerning each other. Operators with higher precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Function_** is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.   </p>

## **<u>Introduction to Python</u>**
<p  style="text-align:justify">Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.</p>

<p  style="text-align:justify">It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Python got its name from “Monty Python’s flying circus”. Python was released in the year 2000.</p>

* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Python is interpreted:_** Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Python is Interactive:_** You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Python is Object-Oriented:_** Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Python is a Beginner's Language:_** Python is a great language for the beginner- Level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications. </p>
## **<u>Python Features</u>**
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify"> Easy-to-learn:_** Python is clearly defined and easily readable. The structure of the program is very simple. It uses few keywords. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify"> Easy-to-maintain:_** Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify"> Portable:_** Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Interpreted:_** Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. So, there is no need to compile a program before executing it. You can simply run the program. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Extensible:_** Programmers can embed python within their C, C++, JavaScript, ActiveX, etc. 
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Free and Open Source:_** Anyone can freely distribute it, read the source code, and edit it. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">High Level Language:_** When writing programs, programmers concentrate on solutions of the current problem, no need to worry about the low level details. </p>
* **_<p  style="text-align:justify">Scalable:_** Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</p>

## **<u> Python interpreter</u>**
**_<p  style="text-align:justify"> Interpreter:_** An interpreter is a translator (computer program) that repeatedly reads instructions (one at a time) and translates them to machine code. It then executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. </p>

**_<p  style="text-align:justify"> Compiler:_** To translate a program written in a high-level language into a low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution. </p>

## **<u> Difference between Compiler and Interpreter</u>**
| Compiler | Interpreter |
| --- | ----------- |
| <p  style="text-align:justify"> Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code. </p> | <p  style="text-align:justify">Translates program one statement at a time. </p>|
| <p  style="text-align:justify"> It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster. </p> | <p  style="text-align:justify"> It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is slower. </p> |
| <p  style="text-align:justify"> Generates intermediate object code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory. </p> | <p  style="text-align:justify"> No intermediate object code is generated, hence are memory efficient. </p> |
| <p  style="text-align:justify"> It generates the error message only after scanning the whole program. Hence debugging is comparatively hard. </p> | <p  style="text-align:justify"> Continues translating the program until the first error is met, in which case it stops. Hence debugging is easy. </p>|
| <p  style="text-align:justify"> Programming language like C, C++ uses compilers. </p> | <p  style="text-align:justify"> Programming languages like Python, Ruby use interpreters. </p> |
## **<u>Modes of Python Interpreter** </u>
Python has two basic modes: script and interactive.

###  **_<u>1. Interactive Mode:</u>_**
<p  style="text-align:justify">Interactive mode is a command line shell which gives immediate feedback for each statement, while running previously fed statements in active memory. As new lines are fed into the interpreter, the fed program is evaluated both in part and in whole.</p>
<p  style="text-align:justify">The code executes via the Python shell, which comes with Python installation. Interactive mode is handy when you just want to execute basic Python commands or you are new to Python programming. </p>
<p  style="text-align:justify">To access the Python shell, open the terminal of your operating system and then type "python". Press the enter key and the Python shell will appear.</p>

![python cmd](./img/2.png)

<p  style="text-align:justify"> The >>> indicates that the Python shell is ready to execute and send your commands to the Python interpreter. The result is immediately displayed on the Python shell as soon as the Python interpreter interprets the command. </p>
<p  style="text-align:justify">To run your Python statements, just type them and hit the enter key. You will get the results immediately, unlike in script mode. For example, to print the text "Hello World", we can type the following:</p>

```python
>>> print("Hello World")
Hello World
```

```python
>>> 10
10
>>> print(5*20)
100
>>> "hi" * 5
'hihihihihi'
>>>
``` 
<p  style="text-align:justify"> It is possible to run multiple Python statements without having to create and save a script. You can also copy your code from another source then paste it on the Python shell. </p>

```python
>>> the_world_is_flat = True
>>> if the_world_is_flat:
        print("Be careful not to fall off!")

Be careful not to fall off
```
### **_<u>Advantages of Interactive Mode_**</u>
* <p  style="text-align:justify"> Helpful when the script is extremely short and wants immediate results. </p>
* <p  style="text-align:justify"> Faster as you only have to type a command and then press the enter key to get the results. </p>
* <p  style="text-align:justify"> Good for beginners who need to understand Python basics. </p>
### **_<u>Disadvantages of Interactive Mode_**</u>
* <p  style="text-align:justify"> Editing the code in interactive mode is hard to move back to the previous commands or else the whole command has to be rewritten again. </p>
* <p  style="text-align:justify"> It's very tedious to run long pieces of code. </p>
### **_<u>2. Script Mode:_**</u>
<p  style="text-align:justify"> In script mode, we type python program in a file and then use interpreter to execute the content of the file. Scripts can be saved to disk for future use. Python scripts have the extension .py, meaning that the filename ends with     <i><b>.py</i></b>. Save the code with <i><b>filename.py</i></b> and run the interpreter in script mode to execute the script. </p>
<p  style="text-align:justify"> In the standard Python shell, click <i><b>"File"</i></b> then choose <i><b>"New"</i></b> or simply hit <i><b>"Ctrl + N"</i></b> on your keyboard to open a blank script in which you can write your code. You can then press <i><b>"Ctrl + S"</i></b> to save it. </p>
<p  style="text-align:justify"> After writing your code, run it by clicking <i><b>"Run"</i></b> then "Run Module" or simply <i><b>press F5</i></b>. </p>

### **_<u>Advantages of Script Mode_**</u>
* It is easy to run large pieces of code.
* Editing your script is easier in script mode.
* Good for both beginners and experts.
### **_Disadvantages of Script Mode_**
* Can be tedious when you need to run only a single or a few lines of code.
* Must create and save a file before executing your code.
